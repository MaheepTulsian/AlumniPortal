        <h3>Message for Alumni</h3>
        <p>I welcome the SRM University-AP Alumni fraternity to the Alumni Relations Portal and extend my heartiest greetings.</p>
        <p>We are proud of your achievements and success. Many of you have seen the university being built brick by brick. I can say with conviction that the pioneering batches would have put their heart and soul in making SRM University-AP stand tall and distinct from others. Your contribution is therefore immense, and we truly acknowledge that.</p>
        <p>We are now 6 years young multi-disciplinary research-intensive university. All major disciplines of sciences, engineering, technology, management, humanities, social sciences and liberal arts are practiced on our campus. We have prepared our next five year (2023-2028) strategic plan with a focus on academic excellence, student satisfaction, research and innovation, financial sustainability and branding & perception.</p>
        <p>In order to achieve academic excellence, we have revamped our curricula applicable from 2023-24 academic year. The objective is to give enormous flexibility to students in terms of inter-disciplinary learning through minor programmes and inter-disciplinary research and projects in an inter-disciplinary classroom setting and teaching. Domain knowledge and their applications, 21st Century skills and values, industry specific projects through internships, major and minor projects, live project problems in regular courses, community services and co-curricular activities are integral part of the curricula.</p>
        <p>We are not only investing in teaching and learning but intensifying research, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit on the campus through many initiatives. This has been possible due to the presence of high caliber students and highly qualified world class faculty who are also supported in many ways for their professional growth.</p>
        <p>However, we are not going to sleep and will continue to march ahead. To achieve this, we need your support on all fronts. You may contribute with your intellect by,</p>
